Experiments with Harmony

## Factor loading

Can Harmony reproduce factor loadings from the SDQ? Attempting to reproduce factor loadings from the 5-factor model from [Karlsson et al](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265481).

## Kufungisisa

How does Harmony handle cultural concepts of distress such as *kufungisisa* (thinking too much) in Shona?

I had to use a Shona transformer model for this. 

Using [Shona symptom questionnaire for the detection of depression and anxiety](https://depts.washington.edu/edgh/zw/hit/web/project-resources/shona_symptom_questionnaire.pdf) and running in Google Colab.

## Multilingual evaluation

Harmony can now handle 8 languages (at least):
* Portuguese, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Hebrew
